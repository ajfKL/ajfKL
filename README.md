i have stop taking drugs completely, as i have realised the effects that it has made on other people and the damages that i have done. it took control of my life and was unable to take controll of it back. now i have realised that my addiction has caused all of this and would like to start a life a new without drugs. i have come to my senses and would like to continue to work and make my hands more productive in the lift line. i know that my family will be happy with the decisions that i have made and to continue to become a better person for myself, family and society. i have also realised that telling lies has not taken me anywhere and only have brought heart ache and pain to those that i have lied to. i wish that the have also realise that when i am high i alway tell lies with out realising the effects that it has made in my life and the life of others around me. i hope that everyone that i have hurt and troubled would be able to forgive and accept this new me. Love you all so much.
